# Welcome to the Machine Learning Module

Welcome to the **Machine Learning** module (ITEMSCINTARTV02) at **Yachay Tech**, a fundamental part of the **Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence** program. This course provides a rigorous and practical introduction to machine learning, one of the most transformative fields in computer science and data-driven industries today.

## Course Vision

Machine Learning (ML) is reshaping the way we interact with data and make decisions. From **e-commerce** and **cybersecurity** to **healthcare** and **big data**, the ability to extract insights and build predictive models is essential in solving complex problems. This module equips students with the ability to:

- Understand the **fundamentals of ML**, including supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning.
- Apply and optimize **state-of-the-art algorithms** using real-world datasets.
- Critically evaluate the **impact and limitations** of ML technologies in diverse contexts.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Describe and explain the **purpose** and use cases of core ML techniques.
- Implement and tune ML models to **extract knowledge** from diverse datasets.
- Select and apply algorithms **based on domain requirements**.
- Engage with **interdisciplinary research** and consider **ethical implications** of AI in society.

## Learning Approach

This module follows a **theory + practice** methodology:

- Each concept is introduced through **interactive lectures** and deepened via **hands-on coding labs** in Python.
- Students will work with **real-world datasets** to explore and implement algorithms.
- The course includes **paper reviews**, **DataCamp self-paced modules**, and **project-based learning** to build strong analytical and technical skills.
